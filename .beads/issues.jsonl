Create QueryOptions struct\n3. Implement retry/timeout logic\n4. Write comprehensive tests\n\n## Methods to Implement\n\n- Page#has(selector)\n- Page#has_element?(selector)  \n- Page#element(selector, opts?)\n- Page#element_optional(selector)\n- Page#elements(selector)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All basic query methods work\n- [ ] Proper error handling (NotFoundError)\n- [ ] Timeout and retry logic\n- [ ] Tests pass with \u003e90% coverage\n\n**See full plan**: docs/plans/QUERY_PORTING_PLAN.md","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"dsisnero@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-21T15:54:05.300118-07:00","created_by":"Dominic Sisneros","updated_at":"2026-02-22T10:25:15.259586-07:00","closed_at":"2026-02-22T10:25:15.259586-07:00","close_reason":"✅ Completed Phase 2: Basic Page Queries\n\nImplemented in :\n\n## QueryOptions struct\n- timeout : Time::Span (default 5s)\n- retry_interval : Time::Span (default 100ms)\n- visible : Bool - Wait for visible elements\n- enabled : Bool - Wait for enabled elements\n\n## Page Query Methods\n- has(selector) : Tuple(Bool, Element?) - Check existence, returns element if found\n- has_element?(selector) : Bool - Convenience boolean check\n- element(selector, opts?) : Element - Find single element (raises NotFoundError)\n- element_optional(selector, opts?) : Element? - Find element or return nil\n- elements(selector, opts?) : Elements - Find all matching elements\n\n## Architecture Improvements\n- Moved Elements struct to element.cr\n- Moved Pages struct to page.cr\n- Eliminated circular dependency between query.cr, element.cr, and page.cr\n- Fixed Defaults module class variable type annotation\n\n## Also Fixed\n- Fixed browser.cr to use Rod::Defaults::SLOW and Rod::Defaults::TRACE constants\n- Fixed Defaults.logger class variable type annotation\n\n## Tests\n- 33 examples, all passing\n- 12 new tests for Page queries\n- Tests cover QueryOptions, has/has_element?, element/element_optional, elements\n\n## Simplified/Stubbed\n- element_by_css raises NotFoundError (placeholder)\n- elements_by_css returns empty Elements (placeholder)\n- Created rod-ane to track full CDP implementation\n\nNext: Phase 3 - Advanced Queries (XPath, Regex, JS) (rod-18n) or implement real queries (rod-ane)","labels":["task"]}
